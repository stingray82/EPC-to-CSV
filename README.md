# EPC-to-CSV
A simple Python Script to scan a folder of EPCs and pull certain data from them

## Works but would benefit from
- Linking to a better OCR engine than Tesseract, Maybe Amazon or Google paid API
- Not using PDF printed versions of the certificates where the text is already hidden, reducing the job of the OCR
- Better refinement on the pulling of address, there is an issue with the tabulated data of the EPC
